# Meeting w3
#### Meeting Organization
Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were both a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Agenda was added to repository on time. It followed a template and was quite precise. I see that you now included actual questions and topics, that is indeed what I expect. The time was assigned to each task.
A point of improvement may be when you know that someone will be responsible for a task, add their name to the task, so that they know that they need to prepare to do this task (individual points for preparation). This applies for all tasks in agenda.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

Notes were written on top of agenda, which is good. They are quite clear, however, some things were copy-pasted from agenda without altering it (for example questions about Scrum are not answered in notes). Responsible people for some planned tasks are not filled in, each person needs to understand what they need to do after each meeting and this should be reflected in your notes.
Agreements written are realistic, but do not forget to distribute the workload equally. Write action points planned for next week, this will help you keep track of your progress and sprint.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Chair ensured that all topics from agenda were covered, let everyone speak and ask questions, and kept good track of time, so meeting finished on time. The meeting was very well organised, agenda was followed and chair made sure that the team does not discuss irrelevant topics. Well done!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

The team  took ownership of the meeting, asked me questions when needed and was active. All people were following the meeting topics, asked questions and answered them. The atmosphere was professional and constructive, you did not discuss not related topics and listened to each other. This is a great improvement from last week.
Note that some team members are still a bit calmer than the others, so more active members need to ensure they give the opportunity to everyone to talk. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

The team presented current state of application (models) at the beginning of the meeting. Continue to do so each meeting. 
Things that were presented were merged to main, but contained some mistakes, so be thorough in your reviews. The progress was good compared to last week, team really thought of a real application and created models accordingly. You are on good track, but also start working on backend and frontend sides - not only basic java. For the first week what you did is good, I see that you put effort into it.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

Team showed their contributions, which seemed equal. According to the team, work distribution was fair and doable. In last agenda, you also had UX, which was not yet done, so you need to reflect on reasons why it was the case and adjust planning of next tasks accordingly.
Also, on next meeting please reflect if any of MRs are not yet merged and the reasons it happened. Talk about how you can improve that. If everyone was on time - well done, just mention it as well.
Conclusion of it: reflect on your progress based on sprint - how much was done, how much was merged, whether everything was achieved.
