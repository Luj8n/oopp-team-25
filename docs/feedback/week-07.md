# Meeting w7

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda

Mark: Very Good

The agenda followed the template and was uploaded on time. It contained clear division of the tasks and 
all individual points. It was precise, and everyone could prepare. It also contained indication of times.
It had all point for discussion. Good job!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

The notes were merged to agenda file, there was a good amount of notes. They contained concrete agreements,
and assigned people, but it would be nice to make tasks more explicit: what exactly should be done instead 
of just name for a task. Agreements were realistic and actionable.




#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

The chair ensured and all the topics in agenda were covered in appropriate time. However, it would be nice to 
be a bit more dynamic in discussion, so if some other topic needs to be discussed, make sure you have time at the end of the meeting.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

The group took ownership of the meeting, almost everyone was active and involved, though sometimes some of the group
members were not very active and did not pay a lot of attention. The atmosphere was constructive and 
only relevant topics were discussed. everyone listened to each other and asked questions.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

The team presented current state of application. The changes that were presented were merged to main (the
ones that were not were specified). I saw the progress compared to last week, but it would be a good 
idea to connect the views and go through all the must-haves in your backlog.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

The students discussed the action list from the last week, tasks were distributed equally between group 
members. Students mostly reached their goals, and were satisfied with their progress.
