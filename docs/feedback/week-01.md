# Get to know each other - meeting W1

#### 1) Self-organization
The team was in charge and spoke a lot. Everybody spoke, but some members were much more talkative than the others. Overall, the atmosphere was friendly and nice, and the tone was respectful both to other members and TA. There were some moments when atmosphere was a bit tense and members were interrupted by others. Overall, despite some "pushy" moments, meeting went smooth.


#### 2) Suggested Topics

The team covered suggested topics, such as introductions, code of conduct and project. Members moderated the meeting well, and discussion was going among all members of group. In the teamwork lecture, you will learn more about meeting moderation, but overall for week 1 preparation was as expected and topics were covered actively.
