# Meeting W2


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

There was a chair (Rens) and a minute taker (Eva).


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

The agenda was created and uploaded on time. It was divided into sections and indicated time - that is a correct thing to do. Please for all next agendas use template from Brighspace (not from GitLab) and do not skip sections (for example feedback). Also, agenda should be ready without any todos left in it for the meeting. I understand that todo was for the notetaker, but please make sure agenda looks ready before the meeting. Agenda should be concrete. For example, for questions you should prepare and write them instead of abstractly leaving time for questions. Same goes for code of conduct, it should be more precise. Then you can assess time more precisely as well.

The level of preparation was good, so most points from agenda were addressed.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

The chair was active and was discussing topics mentioned in agenda. However, not all topics were covered and team ran out of time. Actual time did not correspond to time in agenda. You can read about chair role on Brighspace. You should make sure everyone feels heard and gives opinion. You should also keep track of time and summarize the meeting. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Sufficient

The team took full ownership of the meeting and overall was active, I could see that everyone was prepared. However, not all team members were equally active. Please make sure that everyone is heard and has time to say what they think. All questions need to be listened to carefully, without interruptions. Overall atmosphere was constructive. Please do not underestimate the content of lectures, that makes atmosphere less professional.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

The team discussed product actively, you already have a partial architecture and know what to do. It shows good progress in comparison from the previous week. You already discussed implementation, and actively asked questions, which shows that everyone is on track with current state of product. You also discussed ux/ui, which also indicates that you have thought of what you want to implement. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

The team did not put in agenda work distribution, so it was unclear who worked on what. You did not summarize the points from the previous week, and did not clearly divide tasks for next week. Some team members are much more active, and want to do more tasks. Please be aware that everyone needs to contribute to each part of project. If you feel like distribution of knowledge is uneven, help each other to improve the process instead of taking more tasks. 

At the same time, everyone asked questions, which showed that all team members understood what is discussed, which shows that you prepared well individually or as a group. Please make work distribution more clear next time.
