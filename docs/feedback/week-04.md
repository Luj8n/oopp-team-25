# Meeting w4

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Agenda was added on time and was detailed, with specific questions and times for each topic. Individual points of previous week were clear, please if you divide something (for example showing a demo) for the meeting - also mention names on agenda. Do not forget to include demo to agenda. You followed a template, but also do not remove sections from template, for example summary and feedback round. Very important, always include discussing action points for the meeting. You must discuss plan for the next week (which issues need to be done, till when and divide them). This is included in Brightspace agenda (action points). Please start doing it from next week.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

The notes were merged to agenda file, this is very good. There was good amount of notes - all main points were written down. Planning for the next week is included. The points are clear and notes are easy to read. The agreements are realistic for the week, it is clear what to do next. However, the work was not divided, so there are no assigned people to tasks.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Chair covered all topics from agenda and group was on time to finish the meeting. A bit more time was spent on UI than planned, a chair needed to be reminded to stop with a topic discussion. I put good here because the reminder was before actual stop time of a topic.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Group took ownnership of the meeting, everyone was active and involved, all group participants asked questions, listened to each other and participated in disucssion. Some memebers spoke more, please encourage everyone to speak approximately equally. The atmosphere was professional and constructive.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

The team discussed current state of their application, but did not do a proper demo. For next times, it may be useful to combine those points - each teammate shows what they did through demo (it will also become possible as your application will already include actual features). The progress was seen compared to last week. Group is on track. Please focus on basic features before thinking about more advanced features, as basic features are required to be implemented.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Students discussed action list from the previous week. According to discussions, everyone was satisfied and students reached their goals. Work was distributed among all teammates, it felt like everyone know what was done and needs to be done. Again, do not forget to divide and define action points during the meeting.
