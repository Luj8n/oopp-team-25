# Meeting w6

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

The agenda was added on time and it did follow a template. It contained sprint summary and retrospective, assignees were mentioned. The points were clear, students could prepare for the meeting. For tasks like "Divide UI issues", it's nice to write down concrete issues, so that it's also easier for note taker to just assign people to issues.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

The notes were written on top of agenda - good. The notes are clear and there were a good amount of notes. However, there was no division of tasks for next week and no people were assigned to tasks. Please be aware that sprint planning needs to take place during the meeting. Do make a section for plan: write there actionable and realistic agreements.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

The chair went through all the topics in agenda, they were covered for appropriate amount of time. For next agenda, try to write the times more precisely (for example START was covered faster, but all topics were discussed).


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

The team took ownership of the meeting, everyone was active and participated in discussion. The overall atmosphere was constructive, but please make sure you listen to each other and do not speak at the same moment someone else speaks. Everyone's ideas were taken into account and everyone asked questions.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

The team presented their application, discussed the features and showed them. The changes were clear, the progress was seen from the previous week. Please take a look at Technology assignment for rubric. You discussed UI duirng the meeting, but also do not forget about long-polling and websockets. Take a look at requirements again and revise what you must do to successfully pass the course.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Students discussed the action list, most of goals were reached. The goals that were not reached were discussed and reflected on. Students contribute equally to the team: the tasks are divided clearly. There were no objections from any of team members.
