## Discuss Code of Conduct draft
The Code of Conduct draft: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWI_8tUNYHDYDOodj7TcNYNnLKNWh_OktwJwUrDQRWw \
All points about the draft of the Code of Conduct could be set up for discussion or questioning at this block.
### Section 10: Consequences
What are good consequences to put here?\
Do we want static or dynamic consequences?\
Do we want consequences to be in place at all?

## SCRUM questions
Are there any questions about SCRUM?\
Are there any questions on how we're going to use SCRUM in relation to GitLab?

## Base class structure
We've started on designing the class structure for the data storage: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iS8_Rl77X6YSTOALcPIyPFSMiH_f3QUbDX8EwFwNX58 \
This needs to be discussed that further and a final base structure has to be decided upon, so it can be implemented.
